- [ ] Click unmute button
- [ ] Verify microphone icon changes to unmuted state
- [ ] Confirm audio transmission resumed

**Expected Results**:
- Visual feedback for mute state
- Audio properly muted/unmuted
- Other users see mute status updates

#### 2.2 Deafen Functionality
**Test Case**: Toggle deafen status
- [ ] Join voice channel with other users
- [ ] Click deafen button
- [ ] Verify headphones icon changes to deafened state
- [ ] Confirm incoming audio muted
- [ ] Verify microphone also muted when deafened
- [ ] Click undeafen button
- [ ] Confirm incoming audio restored

**Expected Results**:
- Deafen properly mutes incoming audio
- Automatic microphone mute when deafened
- Visual feedback for deafen state

### 3. Multi-User Testing

#### 3.1 Two-User Voice Chat
**Test Case**: Two users in same voice channel
- [ ] User A joins voice channel
- [ ] User B joins same voice channel
- [ ] Verify WebRTC peer connection established
- [ ] Test bidirectional audio communication
- [ ] Verify user count shows 2 connected users
- [ ] Test mute/unmute with both users

**Expected Results**:
- Clear audio communication between users
- Real-time mute status updates
- Stable peer connection

#### 3.2 Multiple Users (3+)
**Test Case**: Multiple users in voice channel
- [ ] Add third user to voice channel
- [ ] Verify mesh network of peer connections
- [ ] Test audio quality with multiple streams
- [ ] Verify all users can hear each other
- [ ] Test user leaving/rejoining scenarios

**Expected Results**:
- Stable multi-user voice chat
- Good audio quality maintained
- Proper connection management

### 4. Screen Sharing

#### 4.1 Start Screen Share
**Test Case**: User starts screen sharing
- [ ] Join voice channel
- [ ] Click "Start Screen Share" button
- [ ] Verify screen selection dialog appears
- [ ] Select screen/window to share
- [ ] Confirm screen sharing started
- [ ] Verify other users can see shared screen

**Expected Results**:
- Screen sharing permission granted
- Video stream established
- Other users receive screen share stream

#### 4.2 Stop Screen Share
**Test Case**: User stops screen sharing
- [ ] While screen sharing, click "Stop Screen Share"
- [ ] Verify screen sharing stopped
- [ ] Confirm video stream ended
- [ ] Check UI updates properly

**Expected Results**:
- Clean screen share termination
- Resources properly released
- UI properly updated

### 5. Error Handling

#### 5.1 Permission Denied
**Test Case**: User denies microphone permission
- [ ] Attempt to join voice channel
- [ ] Deny microphone permission
- [ ] Verify appropriate error message shown
- [ ] Confirm graceful failure handling

**Expected Results**:
- Clear error message displayed
- No broken UI state
- User can retry after granting permission

#### 5.2 Network Issues
**Test Case**: Handle network disconnections
- [ ] Join voice channel
- [ ] Simulate network disconnection
- [ ] Verify reconnection attempts
- [ ] Test recovery when network restored

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Automatic reconnection when possible
- Clear status indicators

### 6. Performance Testing

#### 6.1 Audio Quality
**Test Case**: Verify audio quality settings
- [ ] Check echo cancellation enabled
- [ ] Verify noise suppression active
- [ ] Test auto gain control
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage during voice chat

**Expected Results**:
- Clear audio with minimal echo
- Background noise suppressed
- Reasonable CPU usage

#### 6.2 Bandwidth Usage
**Test Case**: Monitor network usage
- [ ] Join voice channel with multiple users
- [ ] Monitor bandwidth consumption
- [ ] Test with screen sharing enabled
- [ ] Verify reasonable data usage

**Expected Results**:
- Efficient bandwidth usage
- Stable performance under load
